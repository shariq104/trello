## Future Enhancements to make it better.
As this code does not have any state management tool or any other external library, to improve this project, we can add some drag-drop functionality using gridster, track history of a task (creation, updating, moving etc.).
Besides that, we can define deadlines for tasks and emails or alerts could be generated to notify that.
